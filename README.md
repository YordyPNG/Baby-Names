In this project, I am given 27 years worth of baby names. I had to: 
1) One file listing out all boys names, and the other file listing out all girls name. Include file not found exception handling in your code 
display on the screen the total number of
2) total number of boy babies born in that year and total number of girl babies born in that year
3) The name of baby (boy or girl) that first crossed 10 Millionth babies (summing from most popular baby names, that is, from the top down.)

There will be numerous arrays, eaach year will be two arrays (boy and girl).
They will be in alphabetical order and they will be shown on the screen as well as in a new created file.
